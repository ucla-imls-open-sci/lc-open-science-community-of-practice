Welcome to the lesson **Open Science Community of Practice**.

This lesson provides strategies, templates, and exercises for librarians and research staff to build open science communities. These communities foster inclusive researcher engagement, co-creation, and skill-building while advancing institutional open science goals.

By the end of the session, learners will leave with:

* A draft plan to start or enhance an Open Science Community of Practice (CoP)
* A list of local needs, potential stakeholders, and possible formats
* At least one next step they can take at their institution
