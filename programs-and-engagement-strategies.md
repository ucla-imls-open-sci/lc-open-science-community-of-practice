:::::: questions
- What does stakeholder participation look like?
- What kind of roles might be needed?
- What kind of programming might meet the needs of community practice? (e.g. workshop series, conferences)

::::::

:::::: objectives
- Create program format and schedule
- Choose a content format (e.g. discussion group, workshops, project incubator)
- Choose an engagement strategy

::::::

### Sample Programs and Topics  

- [Open Meet Ups](https://uwopenmeetup.wordpress.com/) — regular discussions and event series  
- [Open Incubator](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/open-incubator) — hands-on workshop program  
- [Open Networks](https://openscience-utrecht.com/about-oscu/) — network of open communities  

## Engagement Strategies for Communities  

Don’t rely only on one-off events. Focus on strategies that build lasting engagement and create regular opportunities for the community to connect and learn.  

For example, many institutions run events during **Open Access Week** or **Love Your Data Week** once a year. These can raise awareness, but ongoing programs like **Open Meet Ups** give people a chance to return, build relationships, and keep learning over time.

## Think–Pair–Share  

- Does your program address the needs you identified?  
- Does the hosting team know how to facilitate discussions or training?  
- How can you help community members build confidence with open science topics?

## Exercise: Create a Program  

Individually or in small groups, design a sample program:  

- Set a schedule (semester, quarter, monthly, biweekly, weekly, or asynchronous)  
- Choose a format (in-person, virtual, or hybrid)  
- Select three to four open science topics to feature  

Use the table below to outline your program:  

| Topic               | Schedule | Format   | Location          | Notes      |  
|---------------------|----------|----------|------------------|------------|  
| Open Topic Example  | 3 pm     | Virtual  | Video Conference | Speaker    |  
|                     |          |          |                  |            |

Afterward, share your program with the group or post it on a shared board.

## Exercise: Engagement Strategies  

Identify one or two ways to foster connection in your community:  

- Pick one **asynchronous** strategy (for example, a listserv or online forum)  
- Pick one **synchronous** strategy (for example, a social gathering or discussion meeting)  

Record your ideas in the table below:  

| Program Example        | Stakeholders        | Team Members     | Partners       | Notes            |  
|------------------------|---------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|  
| Open Science Meet-Up   | Graduate students   | Library staff    | Research Office| Monthly check-in |  
|                        |                     |                  |                |                  |

:::::: keypoints
- Focus on ongoing engagement, not one-off outreach.  
- Plan programs with a clear audience in mind.  
- Choose formats and strategies that support connection and growth.
