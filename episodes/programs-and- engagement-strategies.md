## Engagement Strategies for Communities

Rather than just focusing on typical one-off events for outreach, consider strategies for deeper engagement and building ongoing opportunities for the community to meet and learn. For example, many events for Open Access Week or Love your Data Week are one-time events once a year compared to Open Meet Ups are regular meetings over time.

## Create a program

::: callout
ðŸ“‹ **Exercise: Create a program, schedule, and topic(s)**
Individually or in small groups, write down:
- A periodic schedule (semester, quarter, monthly, biweekly, weekly, asynchronous)
- Choose a location  format (in-person, virtual, hybrid)
- Brainstorm and select 3-4 open science topics to feature in the program

| Topic| Schedule| Format| Location|   Notes  |

|-----------------:|----------------:|-----------------:|---------------:|:---------------|

|                Open Topic|               3pm |                Virtual  |         Video Conference     |  Speaker      |

|                |            |                 |             |         |

Then share out with the group or on a shared board.

## Engagement Strategies

- Choose 1 asynchronous strategy to foster connection (e.g. listserv, online forum)
- Choose 1 synchronous strategy to foster connection (e.g. socials, discussion meetings)
