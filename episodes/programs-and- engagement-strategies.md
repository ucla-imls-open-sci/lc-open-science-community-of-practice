:::::: questions
- What does stakeholder participation look like?
- What kind of roles might be needed?
- What kind of programming might meet the needs of community practice? (e.g. workshop series, conferences)

::::::

:::::: objectives
- Create program format and schedule
- Choose a content format (e.g. discussion group, workshops, project incubator)

Choose 1 asynchronous strategy to foster connection (e.g. listserv, online forum)
Choose 1 synchronous strategy to foster connection (e.g. socials, discussion meetings)

## Why Start Here?

Launching a successful CoP begins with understanding your local context‚Äîwhat‚Äôs missing, what‚Äôs already working, and who‚Äôs already doing the work. This episode helps you identify pain points and map out people and groups who can help you move forward.

> Starting with known needs and existing relationships builds momentum and trust.

## Create a program

::: callout
üìã **Exercise: Create a program, schedule, and topic(s)**
Individually or in small groups, write down:
- A periodic schedule (semester, quarter, monthly, biweekly, weekly, asynchronous)
- Choose a location  format (in-person, virtual, hybrid)
- Brainstorm and select 3-4 open science topics to feature in the program

:::

Then share out with the group or on a shared board.

### Sample Programs and Topics
- Open Meet Ups (discussions and event series)

- Open Incubator (hands-on workshops program)

- Open Networks (network of open communities)

## Identifying Stakeholders

Think about who should be part of or connected to your community:
- Faculty researchers
- Graduate students or postdocs
- Librarians and data support staff
- IT staff or digital infrastructure teams
- Campus centers (e.g., research office, ethics board, grants office)

::: callout
üí¨ **Think‚ÄìPair‚ÄìShare**
- Who are your likely allies?
- Who might benefit but hasn‚Äôt been invited before?
- Who could help advocate for your group?
:::

## Activity: Stakeholder Mapping

Use a 2x2 matrix to sort stakeholders by:
- Level of interest in open science (low to high)
- Level of influence on campus (low to high)

Draw this out or use a sticky note tool. Discuss:
- Who falls in the ‚Äúhigh influence / high interest‚Äù quadrant?
- Who is underrepresented but valuable to include?

## Planning Your Core Team

Try to identify 3‚Äì4 people you could invite to help start or co-lead the CoP. Look for:
- A mix of roles (e.g., researcher, librarian, admin)
- People who have time or are looking for new opportunities
- Early adopters who could bring others in

:::::: keypoints
- Identifying needs helps tailor your community to local goals.
- Stakeholder diversity improves sustainability and reach.
- Starting with a small, committed team can build momentum.
