## What is a Community of Practice?

A community of practice (CoP) is a group of individuals who share a concern, set of problems, or interest in a topic and deepen their knowledge and expertise through regular interaction. In the context of open science, CoPs provide informal, inclusive spaces where researchers and support staff can learn together, build trust, and drive cultural change.

> CoPs aren‚Äôt just training programs‚Äîthey are sustained, peer-driven networks that support ongoing reflection, experimentation, and problem-solving.

### Examples of CoPs in Open Science

- Regular discussion groups hosted by the library or research office
- Online forums or channels organized around reproducibility or FAIR data
- Interdisciplinary working groups that build open workflows together

- What kept people coming back?

## Why CoPs Matter for Open Science

Open science often fails to take root when approached as a one-time workshop or a compliance checkbox. Researchers face:

- Tool overload
- Unclear expectations
- Limited support from peers or mentors

CoPs address this by offering:

- Ongoing, nonjudgmental learning
- Opportunities for co-creation (not just top-down instruction)
- Community norms that make open practices feel natural

‚úÖ **Checkpoint**: What institutional challenges or goals related to open science exist at your institution?
- Write down one.
- Would a CoP help address it? Why or why not?
:::

## Activity: Mapping Benefits of a CoP

Divide learners into small groups (or breakout rooms). Each group discusses:

1. What problem or friction point does open science face on your campus?
2. How might a CoP help address it?
3. What would success look like in a year?

Each group shares one idea back to the full group.

:::::: keypoints
- CoPs provide a structure for shared learning and trust-building.
- Open science benefits from relationship-based change, not just mandates.
- Even small gatherings can become the start of a transformative community.
