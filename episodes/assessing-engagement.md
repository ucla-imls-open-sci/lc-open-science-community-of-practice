### Sample Program: Symposium or Conference  

::: callout
**Case Study: Symposium**  

A community of practice hosted a participant-driven symposium with sessions on open access publishing, open data, open science, and open education. The event featured invited speakers, in-person attendance, and online streaming.  

**How engagement was assessed:** attendance counts, surveys, and observations.  

**What worked well:**  
- Virtual and hybrid options increased access  
- In-person attendees were engaged  
- Programming was well received  
- Team collaboration during planning  

**Areas to improve:**  
- Clearer communication, especially for proposals  
- Stronger promotion  
- Many registrations but lower in-person turnout  
- More cross-department collaboration  
- Targeted promotion to centers and institutes

## Sample Program: Training  

::: callout
**Case Study: Training Program**  

A community of practice hosted a training program to prepare researchers for new policy requirements. The sessions provided hands-on support with data management, data sharing, and related research materials.  

**How engagement was assessed:** pre- and post-tests, surveys, and participant testimonials.  

**What participants reported:**  
- Increased confidence in open access publishing and data management  
- Moderate gains in knowledge of grant compliance resources  
- Strong confidence in finding public access and data sharing resources at their home institution (FSU)  
- Some confidence in finding resources at external institutions  
- Most respondents said the training probably prepared them for upcoming public access requirements

Individually or in small groups, design one to three ways to assess engagement in your program.  

- List the assessment method(s) you selected  
- Note which program or strategies you would evaluate  
- Identify which stakeholders should receive the results

## Think–Pair–Share  

- Does your program address the needs you identified?  
- Can the hosting team effectively facilitate discussions or training?  
- How can you help community members build confidence with open science topics?  

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::: keypoints
- Use different methods to measure engagement.  
- Assess goals before, during, and after programs.  
- Apply feedback to strengthen the community of practice.
